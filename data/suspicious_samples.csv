"IPO season is back Nifty50 15,814 ▼ -45 (-0.2%) Sensex 52,735 ▼ -189 (-0.3%) After a gap-up opening the markets witnessed profit booking. Of the Nifty50 stocks, 27 stocks closed in the red. Among the Nifty sectoral indices, PSU Bank (2.4%) and Metal (1.2%) were top gainers, whereas Media (-0.6%) and IT (-0.4%) declined the most. Top gainers (Nifty50) Dr Reddy's ▲ 1.8% Hindalco ▲ 1.7% Divis Lab ▲ 1.7% Top losers (Nifty50) HDFC Life ▼ 4.1% Titan ▼ 1.3% TCS ▼ 1.1% Here are the top stories of the day. Dr Reddy’s launches Covid drug The pharma major today announced that it has launched 2-deoxy-D-glucose ( 2-DG ), which is a drug it developed along with the Defence Research and Development Organisation for the treatment of Covid patients. The company will supply 2-DG to government and private hospitals across India. Shares of Dr Reddy’s were up around 1.8% today. Thyrocare slips on acquisition by PharmEasy Shares of diagnostic chain Thyrocare Technologies fell by around 9% after online pharmacy PharmEasy’s parent said on Friday that it will acquire 66% stake in the diagnostics firm. The acquisition price is ₹1300 per share, about 10% lower than the previous closing price. The online pharmacy platform is buying a majority stake in Thyrocare for ₹4,546 crore . The deal will trigger an open offer for the purchase of an additional 26% stake in the company. Power Mech bags big project The infrastructure and construction company today announced that it has bagged a ₹9,294 crore project for mine development and operations from a subsidiary of state-owned Coal India. The contract is almost 4x the Power Mech's FY21 revenue. The project, which has been awarded to a consortium headed by Power Mech Projects, will be for 25 years. The shares of the company have risen by around 6% today. IPOs make strong listing Shares of Dodla Dairy today listed at a premium of 28.5% to their issue price of ₹428. Similarly, Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS Hospital) also made a strong debut, listing on the exchanges at 22% higher than its issue price of ₹825. The IPO action is expected to continue in the coming week. India Pesticides, which was oversubscribed 29 times on Friday, is set to hit the exchanges on July 5. Closing bell The markets struggled to hold fort at higher levels due to weakness in index heavyweights Reliance Industries and the HDFC twins. Today, the government announced further relief measures for pandemic-affected sectors, including healthcare, microfinance and tourism. Primarily, the government will provide guaranteed coverage to banks and NBFCs on the emergency credit extended to businesses in these sectors. Meanwhile, investors appear to be confident in sectors where demand is rather certain, such as the sugar sector where the underlying demand for ethanol remains strong. Good to know What is an open offer? When a company A acquires a majority stake in company B, it is required to provide an opportunity to the existing shareholders of company B to sell their shares. This is referred to as an open offer. In India, an open offer is triggered when a company buys a majority or more than 15% stake in a listed company. The acquirer has to make an open offer to buy at least an additional 26% stake in the company. It is seen as an exit route for the minority shareholders in the event of a new management taking over.

"Slide continues Market recap The day that was, in 5 minutes February 18, 2022 NIFTY50 17,276 ▼ 28 (-0.1%) SENSEX 57,832 ▼ 59 (-0.1%) Daily UPload The markets edged downwards for the third consecutive day and closed flat amid intraday volatility. 32 of the Nifty50 stocks closed in the red. European stocks rose on strong corporate earnings and easing Russia-Ukraine tensions. Among the Nifty sectoral indices, Financial Services (+0.2%) and Nifty Bank (+0.1%) were the top gainers, while Realty (-1.2%) and Oil and Gas (-1.0%) were the top losers. What's UP Stock Today's change Coal India ▲ 2.6% SBI Life ▲ 1.8% Bajaj Auto ▲ 1.0% What's Down Stock Today's change ONGC ▼ 2.1% Divi's Lab ▼ 2.0% Cipla ▼ 2.0% UPnews Ambuja posts weak Q3 AMBUJACEM (NSE): ₹338.5 ▼21.3 (-5.9%) The cement major posted standalone revenues of ₹3,735 crore, up 6% year-on-year on the back of subdued demand and flat realisations. Meanwhile, its net profit declined 49% year-on-year to ₹252 crore mainly due to steep rise in fuel prices and a one-time restructuring cost of ₹66 crore. The Board has approved a capex of ₹3,500 crore for a cement grinding expansion plan of potential 7 million tonnes across its units. According to the management, the cement growth is expected to remain positive backed by increased demand for housing combined with the government's thrust on infrastructure development. Banks to see major credit growth Experts believe that the banking sector can witness a 10% credit growth in FY23 on the back of a pick-up in economic activity, higher government spending in the infrastructure sector and revival in retail demand. The capex revival, higher exports, commodity inflation, increased working capital demand due to higher output can propel corporate performance in the next fiscal. Bank credit growth in the corporate segment could be around 8% in FY23. Large private banks are likely to continue gaining market share while public sector banks will have to be cautious on the asset quality as they have a larger proportion of small and medium-enterprise loans. Metaverse to boost data usage RELIANCE (NSE): ₹2,427.3 ▼16.2 (-0.6%), BHARTIARTL (NSE): ₹712.0 ▼5.0 (-0.7%) According to a Credit Suisse report, metaverse is likely to boost data usage by as much as 20 times in the next 10 years. The report says metaverse has enormous potential to further expand screen time and drive more bandwidth consumption. It further states that telecom operators Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio are well placed to benefit from the surge in India. Gaming is another segment that will gain from the adoption of metaverse. Currently, mobile gaming is gaining traction due to the availability of affordable smartphones and 4G data services IPO Corner The much-awaited LIC IPO is likely to open for subscription to anchor investors on March 11 , according to the reports. This is expected to be India’s biggest ever IPO. LIC is expected to seek the regulator’s approval in the first week of March. Learn with UPSToX What is FMA? FMA or the first-mover advantage is the advantage gained by a company that first introduces a product or service in the market. It helps the company establish a strong brand recognition before other entrants to the market. For example, Amazon was among the first large online bookstores. By the time others established their online presence, Amazon had achieved significant brand recognition and leveraged its first-mover advantage by marketing a range of additional products.

"Markets end winning streak ▼ Nifty 16,568 (-0.2%) ▼ Sensex 55,629 (-0.2%) After a gap-up opening, the benchmark indices slid downward throughout the day and ended in negative territory, snapping the four-day long rally. The market breadth favoured the bears, with 30 of the Nifty50 stocks closing in the red. Sectorally, Nifty’s FMCG (+0.6%) and PSU Bank (+0.2%) indices closed the strongest, while Bank (-0.8%) and Metal (-0.8%) were the top losers today. Top gainers (Nifty50) Eicher Motors ▲ 2.6% UltraTech ▲ 2.4% Bajaj Finance ▲ 2.0% Top losers (Nifty50) Kotak Bank ▼ 2.3% Hindalco ▼ 2.3% ICICI Bank ▼ 2.0% Here are the top stories of the day. HAL soars on deal with GE for Tejas aircraft As per reports, the state-run defense and aerospace company has placed a ₹5,375 crore order with US-based General Electric (GE) Aviation. This is the largest ever order placed by HAL. As per the deal, GE Aviation will supply engines and support systems to power the Tejas light combat aircraft (LCA). HAL’s collaboration with GE Aviation will be boosted further with the manufacturing of these engines locally under the LCA MkII program. Its shares closed 5.2% higher today. RBI removes restriction on HDFC Bank credit cards The RBI today lifted the restriction on HDFC Bank on issuing new credit cards, which was imposed after the bank reported repeated outages in its digital platforms. Following this, shares of the leading private lender rose over 3% intraday. However, the stock gave up its gains and closed lower for the day. Credit cards account for 25–30% of HDFC Bank’s fee revenue. As per analysts, the removal of restrictions is timely in the wake of the upcoming festive season, when strong growth is seen in credit card and unsecured credit products. Investors high on liquor stocks Liquor stocks witnessed a surge today with shares of United Breweries, Globus Spirits, United Spirits and GM Breweries rising 5–10%. The recent jump comes after several states across the country have eased lockdown restrictions. Further, as per United Spirits, the outlook for Indian alcoholic beverage markets remains positive owing to favourable demographics, rising disposable incomes, and growing rural consumption. Closing bell The gap-up opening and weak closing indicates that the short-term uptrend has lost some steam. It also indicates that markets run the risk of profit booking or consolidation in the coming days. Meanwhile, the revival of monsoon is a positive indicator for industries with rural connection, e.g. tractors and the consumption-driven FMCG sector. FMCG stocks also benefit from being defensive, in case markets witness some correction. Good to know What is a dividend-payout ratio? The dividend-payout ratio reveals how much of a company’s net profit is given out to its shareholders as dividend. It is calculated by dividing the dividend paid by the net profit. For instance, assume that a company’s net profit is ₹10 crore and it pays a dividend of ₹7 crore. This means the dividend-payout ratio is 70%. A higher dividend-payout ratio is usually good for investors, unless the company has better avenues to reinvest profits. Tell us what you think about today's newsletter. That's all for today.

"Bulls make a comeback, but fall short ▼ Nifty 15,709 (-0.2%) ▼ Sensex 52,443 (-0.2%) It was a see-saw session where the first of the session was dominated by the bears and the second half by the bulls. Nonetheless, the markets closed on a negative note, as 27 of the Nifty50 stocks closed in the red. Among the Nifty sectoral indices, only Metal (+1.2%) and IT (+0.2%) ended positively, whereas PSU Bank (-1.8%) and Auto (-0.9%) lost the most. Top gainers (Nifty50) Bharti Airtel ▲ 5.0% Tata Steel ▲ 2.8% SBI Life ▲ 2.1% Top losers (Nifty50) Kotak Bank ▼ 2.5% Dr Reddy's ▼ 2.5% Tata Motors ▼ 2.2% Here are the top stories of the day. Maruti’s profit tumbles in Q1 In the June quarter, India’s leading car manufacturer’s net profit dropped by 62% sequentially to ₹440 crore due to lower sales. The street expected a net profit of ₹878 crore . The company’s net sales declined by 26% QoQ to ₹16,798 crore as the second wave dented demand. The company said that the commodity prices increased steeply but it continues to take steps to reduce costs. In positive developments, the car marker spent less on promotions and increased the selling price of its vehicles in Q1FY22. Shares of Maruri Suzuki were down 1.3% today. Coforge posts strong profit in Q1 IT services company Coforge reported a 55% YoY jump in its consolidated net profit to ₹124 crore for the June quarter. The profit growth was supported by a 38% rise in the revenue from operations to ₹1,462 crore . The Q1 figures also include the contribution from SLK Global, which the company acquired in April 2021. The total executable order book over the next 12 months grew 39% YoY to $645 million. Further, the company said that it has secured 3 large deals, including a $105 million engagement. It is planning for an organic growth of at least 19% in constant currency terms during FY22, which is higher than the 17% growth indicated earlier. The stock was up 0.5% today and has gained 62% so far this fiscal. BLS International posts profitable Q1 In the June quarter, the global visa outsourcing service provider reported a consolidated net profit of ₹20 crore compared to a loss of 80 lakh in Q1FY21. In the same period, the company’s revenue rose by 242% to ₹178 crore. The management has said that as borders reopen globally it expects visa business to start contributing again in the coming quarters, which is expected to significantly improve its financial performance in FY22. Shares of the company were up 11% today after the results were announced yesterday post the market hours. Closing Bell The market showed completely opposite trends today. It started on an extremely weak note and dived down. However, as it reached closer to the lower end of the current consolidation range (15450-15950), buying interest emerged. Favourable opening of the European indices also provided positive cues. Meanwhile, unlike the decent results posted by the Indian IT companies earlier this month, the recently announced results by other large companies have been below street estimates. This is acting as a sentiment spoiler especially at the time when markets are trading close to their lifetime highs. The US Fed is expected to announce its interest decision tonight. While the street expects rates to remain unchanged, Fed’s commentary could have a bearing on how markets open tomorrow. Good to know What is a moving average? A moving average is a technical indicator that helps to identify a trend in the price of a stock. Traders also use moving averages to determine support and resistance levels. Thus, by studying moving averages, traders can spot buying and selling opportunities. Some of the widely used moving averages are 5-day and 20-day for short term trading and 50-day and 200-day for long term investment. Tell us what you think about today's newsletter.

"Reliance has a PET project ▲ Nifty 16,294 (+0.2%) ▲ Sensex 54,492 (+0.2%) After initial weakness, the markets recovered and closed in the positive. The market breadth was nearly even, with 26 of the Nifty50 stocks witnessing gains. Among the Nifty sectoral indices, Metal (+1.2%) and IT (+0.7%) were the strongest, while PSU Bank (-2.2%) and Media (-1.5%) fell the most. Top gainers (Nifty50) Bharti Airtel ▲ 3.8% Eicher Motors ▲ 3.4% ITC ▲ 3.0% Top losers (Nifty50) SBI ▼ 3.2% IndusInd Bank ▼ 2.3% ICICI Bank ▼ 1.8% Here are the top stories of the day. Reliance to double PET recycling capacity Reliance Industries has said that it will double its polyethylene terephthalate (PET) recycling capacity. Srichakra Ecotex India will build and operate this new facility for Reliance Industries in Andhra Pradesh. This new facility will take Reliance Industries recycling capacity to 5 billion post-consumer PET bottles and help India in maintaining a recycling rate of more than 90%. These post-consumer PET bottles are used as a raw material for manufacturing recycled polyester fiber. Shares of Reliance Industries rose around 1.3% today. Tata Communications’ profit grows, revenues fall Digital transformation player Tata Communications reported a 15% YoY rise in its consolidated net profit to ₹296 crore . During the same period, revenues contracted nearly 7% to ₹4,103 crore, mainly due to a reduction in the Voice business. Revenues from the Data business, which contributes over 75% of total revenues, declined 2.2% YoY to ₹3,104 crore. The company said that business was impacted by the second wave during the quarter, but demand is slowly recovering as global markets are opening up. Nonetheless, shares of Tata Communications were down 0.3% today. Oil prices tumble Oil prices declined for the third consecutive day on Wednesday, hitting a two-week low . So far this week, crude oil prices are down over 7%. The more than expected rise in US crude inventories and worries over the spread of the Delta variant are creating demand concerns. Surprisingly, the oil prices fell even though the geopolitical tension continued to increase in the Middle East with Iran reportedly seizing an oil tanker. Usually, the rise in geopolitical tension ends up hurting oil supplies, which leads to a rise in prices. Closing Bell The market showed signs of jitteriness after a strong rally seen this week, as may be traders inclined to think that profit booking could follow. Further, the RBI will announce its interest rate decision tomorrow, which could lead to some volatility. Basically, the markets are in a completely new orbit and uncharted territory. During such times, if the markets sustain and rise further, it lends to investor confidence. However, any adverse development generally creates an initial panic and sharp drop to critical support levels. Good to know What is an interest-coverage ratio? Interest-coverage ratio reveals whether a company will be able to pay interest on its debt. It is calculated by dividing a company’s earnings before interest and tax by the interest due. A higher interest-coverage ratio is considered to be an indicator that a company is in a strong financial position. Lenders and investors can use it to determine a company’s ability to survive hardships. Tell us what you think about today's newsletter. That's all for today. We'll be back again tomorrow!

"[Important] Impact on Instant Orders created before June 30, 2022 Dear Ansh, You might have recently come across our previous communication sent on June 21, 2022, titled “TDS Tax Update on Crypto Investments” mentioning about the upcoming changes in our trading policies post the implementation of the TDS rules for Crypto assets as decided by the Government of India. To implement these guidelines, we’ll be taking the following action on some open orders between 10:00 PM and 11:59 PM on June 30, 2022. Please keep reading for more details. Cancel all pending sell orders in INR: All fully open/partially open Instant orders to sell crypto assets for INR will get canceled if not completely filled by the above mentioned time. In case of partially open Instant orders, the executed part of your trade will remain as is and the rest would be canceled. Please note that stablecoins like USDT are considered as crypto assets. Please note that these would affect both Limit and Instant orders. However, this will not affect any of your current trades that are already fully executed or partially closed. For example, if you place a Limit order on ETH/INR for INR 40,000 and it doesn’t get executed since the current price is INR 45,000, and the time crosses 10:00 PM on June 30, 2022. This order will thus get canceled. As another example, if you place an Instant order at 09:59:59 PM on June 30, 2022 for buying ETH with INR and it somehow doesn’t get executed, then it will be canceled and any amount blocked will be automatically refunded. This will also not affect any trades created on or after July 01, 2022, which will start being compliant with the TDS regulations set by the Government of India. We would humbly request you to plan your trades accordingly. Your smooth investment experience is our highest priority. In case of any further queries, please reach out to us at Support here .

"No Monday blues Market recap The day that was, in 5 minutes March 14, 2022 NIFTY50 16,871 ▲ 240 (+1.4%) SENSEX 56,486 ▲ 935 (+1.6%) Daily UPload Despite a subdued opening, markets resumed the uptrend and closed in the green for the fifth consecutive day. In all, 37 stocks of the Nifty50 pack ended in the positive. On hopes of progress in the Russia-Ukraine peace talks, crude oil prices fell 5% during the day, which created a positive sentiment. Among the Nifty sectoral indices, Media (2.4%) and Bank (+2.2%) were the top gainers, while Realty (-1.6%) and Oil & Gas (-0.5%) were the top losers. What's UP Stock Today's change Infosys ▲ 3.7% HDFC Bank ▲ 3.2% SBI Bank ▲ 3.2% What's Down Stock Today's change IOC ▼ 2.5% ONGC ▼ 2.3% HUL ▼ 1.6% UPnews Paytm shares hit record low PAYTM (NSE): ₹680 ▼ 94 (-12.2%) Shares of One 97 Communications (Paytm) hit record low after the RBI directed Paytm Payments Bank to temporarily halt onboarding of new customers. The central bank had observed certain supervisory concerns at the payments bank. Paytm, which owns a 49% stake in Paytm Payments Bank, doesn’t foresee a major impact on Paytm’s overall business due to these developments. However, investors got cold feet owing to regulatory uncertainty. Jubilant FoodWorks falls amid CEO’s resignation JUBLFOOD (NSE): ₹2,514 ▼ 349 (-12.2%) Jubilant FoodWorks, which holds the master franchise rights of Domino’s Pizza, saw its shares plunge as its CEO’s exit was announced. This comes at a time when it has started seeing recovery in delivery and takeaway channels. Further, it has not only expanded its store network (to 1,500 Domino’s stores in India) but also the product portfolio (added Popeye’s). The street would watch out for the name of the new CEO before taking a meaningful bet. Inflation above street estimates India’s consumer inflation for February inched up to 6.07%, its 8-month high. The figure was well above the street estimates of 5.93% and RBI’s upper limit of 6%. Overall, the price rise was primarily seen in rural areas and the increase was mainly due to higher fuel prices. Meanwhile, wholesale inflation too rose and stood at 13.11%. Since producers generally pass on the rising costs to their customers, the WPI inflation is seen as a precursor to high retail prices. IPO Corner As per media reports, the mega IPO of LIC, which was set to launch this month, is now likely to launch around mid-May with the hope that the market turbulence triggered by the Russia-Ukraine conflict will be resolved. If the IPO is delayed beyond May, the government may have to file fresh papers with updated financial numbers. Learn with UPSToX What is a safe-haven investment? A safe haven is a type of investment that is expected to maintain or increase in value during an economic downturn. It is perceived to be a relatively safe option for investors to limit their exposure to risky assets like stocks. Examples of safe haven investment include precious metals like gold. Since gold is a physical commodity, it’s supply remains stable unlike cash. Gold is often considered as one of the safest options to invest in times of economic instability. During the 2008-09 financial global crisis, prices of gold rose significantly. How did we did do in today's market recap? What else would you like to read in these emails?
